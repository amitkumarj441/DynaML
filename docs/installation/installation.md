## Platform Compatibility

Currently DynaML installs and runs on \*nix platforms, though it is possible to build the project on windows, running the generated .bat file might not work and one would need to resort to using the `java -jar` command.

### Pre-requisites

* sbt
* A modern HTML5 enabled browser (to view plots generated by Wisp)
* BLAS, LAPACK and ARPACK binaries for your platform. In case they are not installed, it is possible to disable this feature by commenting out (`//`) the section of the build.sbt file given below.

  ```scala
    "org.scalanlp" % "breeze-natives_2.11" % "0.11.2" % "compile",
  ```

## Steps

* Clone this repository
* Run the following.


    ```shell
    sbt
    ```

    The sbt shell will open

    ```shell
    [info] Loading project definition from ~/DynaML/project
    [info] Set current project to DynaML
    >
    ```

* Build the source


    ```shell
    stage
    ```

* After the project builds, exit from the sbt console and execute the DynaML start script from the bash shell. Make sure you have execute permissions on the DynaML start script.


    ```
    ./target/universal/stage/bin/dynaml
    ```

    You will get the following prompt.

    ```scala
    Welcome to DynaML v1.4.1-beta.3
    Interactive Scala shell for Machine Learning Research
    (Scala 2.11.8 Java 1.8.0_101)

    ```
