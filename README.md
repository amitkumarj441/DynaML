DynaML is a Scala environment for conducting research and education in Machine Learning. DynaML comes packaged with a powerful library of classes for various predictive models and a Scala REPL where one can not only build custom models but also play around with data work-flows. It can also be used as an educational/research tool for data analysis.

Currently DynaML supports.

* Regularized Ordinary Least Squares
* Logistic and Probit Models for binary classification
* Regression and Classification with kernel based Dual LS-SVM
* Regression and Classification with Gaussian Processes
* Feed forward Neural Networks
* Committee Models
  - Neural Committee Models
  - Gaussian Process Committee Models
* Model Learning and Optimization
  - Gradient Descent
  - Conjugate Gradient
  - Committee Model Solver
  - Back propogation with momentum
  - LSSVM linear solver
* Model tuning
  * Grid Search
  * Maximum Likelihood (ML-II)
  * Coupled Simulated Annealing
* Model validation metrics (RMSE, Area under ROC)
* Entropy based data subset selection
* Data Pipes for configurable workflows
* Tensorflow Integration

Include
--------

To include DynaML in your maven JVM project edit your ```pom.xml``` file as follows

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
      <id>jitpack.io</id>
      <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.transcendent-ai-labs</groupId>
  <artifactId>DynaML</artifactId>
  <version>v1.4</version>
</dependency>
```

for sbt projects edit your `build.sbt` (see [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#transcendent-ai-labs/DynaML) for more details)

```scala
resolvers += "jitpack" at "https://jitpack.io"
libraryDependencies += "com.github.transcendent-ai-labs" % "DynaML" % version
```



Installation
============

Platform Compatibility
----------------------
DynaML installs and runs on *nix platforms, though it is possible to build the project on windows, running the generated .bat file might not work and one would need to resort to using the `java -jar` command.

Pre-requisites
-------------
* sbt
* A modern HTML5 enabled browser (to view plots generated by Wisp)
* BLAS, LAPACK and ARPACK binaries for your platform. In case they are not installed, it is possible to disable this feature by commenting out (`//`) the section of the build.sbt file given below.

  ```scala
    "org.scalanlp" % "breeze-natives_2.11" % "0.11.2" % "compile",
  ```

Steps
-------

* Clone this repository
* Run the following.
```shell
  sbt
```

The sbt shell will open

```shell
 [info] Loading project definition from ~/DynaML/project
 [info] Set current project to DynaML (in build file:~/Development/DynaML/)
 >
```

Now enter the following commands

```shell
>stage
>console
```

After the project builds, you should get the following prompt.

```
       _        _        _          _             _                  _   _         _
